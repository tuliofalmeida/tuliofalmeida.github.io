## Hello World!

I'm a neuroengineer enthusiastic about neuroscience, computer vision, machine learning and open-source softwares.
My general research interests include associate artificial intelligence with neural data processing. Check out some of the 
[projects](https://tuliofalmeida.github.io/projects/) I've been working on or [follow me](https://twitter.com/tuliofalmeida) on twitter!
 
## What am I up to?

I'm part of the Pre-Doc + PhD program of the Initiative for interdisciplinary research in Biology ([i-Bio](http://ibio.sorbonne-universite.fr/)) of [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/). I will be doing rotations in three different laboratories at the [Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine (IBPS)](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and the [Institut du Fer à Moulin (IFM)](https://ifm-institute.org/en/home/) at the Sorbonne University:

1. Project title “Leveraging machine learning and neural field modeling to understand the role of REM sleep in emotional memory consolidation and homeostasis”. Supervisors Gabrielle Girardeau ([Girardeau Lab](https://girardeaulab.org/), IFM) & Wilten Nicola ([Nicola Computational Neuroscience Lab](https://www.nicolacomputationalneurosciencelab.com/), University of Calgary)
2. Project title “Regulation of gene expression coupled to cell growth and division in bacterial adaption processes” Supervisors [Bianca Sclavi](https://sites.google.com/site/biancasclavi/?pli=1) ([Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/computational-and-quantitative-biology/genome-biology), IBPS) & Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino ([Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino Lab](https://www.ifom.eu/en/cancer-research/research-labs/research-lab-cosentinolagomarsino.php), [IFOM](https://www.ifom.eu/en/), University of Milan)
3. Project title “Dissecting how excitable ependymal cells participate to locomotor rhythms using an all-optical approach” Supervisors Jean-Marie Mangin ([Development of the spinal cord organization](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/neuroscience/development-of-the-spinal-cord-organization), IBPS) & Georges Debregeas ([Laboratory Jean Perrin](https://www.labojeanperrin.fr/?gdebregeas), IBPS)

I'm currently at [Development of the spinal cord organization](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/neuroscience/development-of-the-spinal-cord-organization)!

## Before PhD

I received my M.Sc. in Neuroengineering from the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience ([IIN-ELS](http://www.institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/unidade/edmond-and-lily-safra-international-institute-of-neurosciences/)), where I worked with Dr. André Dantas and Dr. Abner Rodrigues developing a open-source system for measuring and analyzing data from inertial sensors, fully availabe in [PyJAMA](https://github.com/tuliofalmeida/pyjama). Throughout my M.Sc. I became interested in research electrophysiological data and animal behavior, developing [PyRAT](https://github.com/pyratlib/pyrat), an open source python library to process tracking data. Also, after finishing my master's degree, I received a technical support scholarship to work at IIN-ELS with Abner Rodrigues, using connectivity techniques to analyze electrophysiological data from rats during seizures.

## Beyond the academy

I am currently running around Paris and will run the Paris Marathon in 2024 and am documenting this process in [photos](https://www.instagram.com/running2marathon/)!
